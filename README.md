# data_cleaning_layoff
This project focuses on cleaning the raw "Layoff" dataset, which includes employee demographics, job details, and layoff outcomes. The goal is to handle missing values, standardize data formats, remove duplicates, and address inconsistencies, preparing the dataset for further analysis and predictive modeling.
